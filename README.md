## Abstract

This study explores the intricate relationship between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and life expectancy in India. Using statistical methods such as **correlation** and **multiple regression analysis**, we analyze indicators like GDP, GNI, school enrolment, unemployment, and public health factors to determine their influence on life expectancy.

##  Key Objectives
- Identify socioeconomic and health-related factors affecting life expectancy in India.  
- Evaluate the contribution of SDG-related variables to improvements in life expectancy.  
- Employ regression and correlation analysis to identify key predictors.

---

## Methodology
- **Software Used:** SPSS, Python, and Microsoft Excel  
- **Data Source:** World Bank â€“ World Development Indicators (1990â€“2021)  
- **Variables Analyzed:**  
  - GDP per capita (PPP)  
  - GNI per capita (PPP)  
  - Fertility rate  
  - Unemployment rate  
  - School enrolment  
  - Prevalence of undernourishment  
  - Age dependency ratio, etc.

---

##  Statistical Techniques
- Univariate analysis  
- Bivariate (Pearson correlation) analysis  
- Multivariate regression (Backward elimination)  
- Multicollinearity check using **VIF**  
- Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation  

---

##  Key Findings
- Life expectancy is positively associated with GDP, GNI, school enrolment, and food production index.  
- Negative influence observed from fertility rate, age dependency ratio, and undernourishment.  
- Final regression model explains **93.2%** of the variation in life expectancy (Adjusted RÂ² = 0.932).
